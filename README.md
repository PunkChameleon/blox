- Notes

- Define globals up top.
- Create loop that randomly generates size, positioning of other blocks.
- Play with White and Black backgrounds
- Play with different color blocks, and different block styles
 

- Clean up UI and Refactor the code to make it pretty pretty.
- Refactor code from unit.html into the actual application.
