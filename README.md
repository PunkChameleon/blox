Currently, unit.html is the "most done" part, feel free to run it inside of chrome or firefox.

- Work on check collosion function.... it's acting buggy. so I'm checking X or Y I need to do AND
  to make sure real collosion is happening, not just hitting the x or y axis the other item is on.
  and it seems to not be re populating and recycling elements, like it's being global in an odd way.
  lets stop for now, read, sleep, and get back on this soon... but it's "working" to a point and just needs 
  to be debugged... then this project is over :oD
  

  

- Refactor code from unit.html into the actual application.
