A game of blocks.
----
Run unit.html, 
everything else should be ignored....
----



- Bugs
	If the block is near a wall while its growing it grows into the wall and stays stuck..


- Notes

- Define globals up top.
- Create loop that randomly generates size, positioning of other blocks.
- Play with White and Black backgrounds
- Play with different color blocks, and different block styles


- Clean up UI and Refactor the code to make it pretty pretty.
- Refactor code from unit.html into the actual application.
