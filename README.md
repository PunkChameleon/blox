A game of blocks.
----
Currently, unit.html is the "most done" part, feel free to run it inside of chrome or firefox.

- We need to destroy the element fully when it is dead, 
	currently we are only not redrawing it, but it still has positioning and x - y variables.
	also clean up code and make it more elegant

- There's a bug when eating an element and you're at the border, you get "stuck";  



- Refactor code from unit.html into the actual application.
